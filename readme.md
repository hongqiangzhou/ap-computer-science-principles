#### Uint 1: Digital Information
__Bits and Bytes:__ 
1. A bit is the smallest piece of information in a computer. A bit has two possible values ("0" or "1").
2. A byte has 8 bits (example: 00010011). Need to know how to convert between bindary and decimal numbers (example: `00010011` represents  `16+2+1=19`). If the last bit is "0", the number must be an even number; if the last bit is "1", it must be an odd number.
3. A byte can represent 256 different decimal numbers (`2^8=256`). The highest number a byte can represent is 255 (`2^8-1`).
